Individuals may walk in to any of the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVC) or polyclinics offering the vaccines recommended for the different age groups. Alternatively, you may book an appointment at a JTVC or Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) using this [link](https://book.health.gov.sg/covid). On days where there is high demand for vaccination, a longer waiting period is expected.
 
Under the National Vaccination Programme, children/wards below 18 years must have the consent of their parents/guardians to receive their vaccination. Those between the age of 13 to 17 years must bring a completed and signed hard or electronic copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/parcf/">here</a>. Those aged 12 and below must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians should also bring along their child/ward's identification document (e.g. Birth Certificate and Health booklet/passport/student identification card/Singpass) for verification.
