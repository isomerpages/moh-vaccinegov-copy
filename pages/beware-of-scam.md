We are aware of websites, emails, SMS text messages and phone calls falsely claiming to offer registration for COVID-19 vaccination. Please note that you can walk in to our Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) to receive your vaccination. Appointments can also be made at [https://book.health.gov.sg/covid](https://book.health.gov.sg/covid). We advise the public to check the [MOH Website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination) for information on Singaporeâ€™s COVID-19 vaccination programme. 

Please always verify the authenticity of instructions before offering any personal or financial information. You can also call the MOH COVID-19 General Enquiries Hotline at 6995 9199 if you have any queries. Thank you.
