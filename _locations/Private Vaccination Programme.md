The Private Vaccination Programme (PVP) allows individuals (including Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Visit Pass holders) to take COVID-19 vaccines, but who do not qualify under the National Vaccination Programme, to do so based on a doctor's assessment. As this is a private arrangement between the vaccinated person and his/her attending doctor, the vaccinations will be at the individual's own cost and would not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP).<br><br>
Individuals may opt to receive either the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine or the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine under the PVP.<br><br>
To book an appointment or for any enquiries, please directly contact the clinics in the list below.
